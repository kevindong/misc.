### List of Projects
* GenEdMatcher - Given two input files (one file being courses available; the other being courses that can be used to fulfill degree requirements), this program will print out the courses that can be used to fulfill degree requirements and are available. 
* battleship - Originally based off of the battleship game that the Python course on Codecademy had users build. Now expanded and in desperate need of polishing. 
* pws-scraper - This program scrapes Purdue University (West Lafayette)'s listing of work-study jobs and outputs a more readable version of the listings. This program can also detect if new jobs have been posted since the last time the program was run.
* tip-calculator - A tip calculator that more accurately reflects how people actually tip.
